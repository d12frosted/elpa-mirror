                           A MASTODON CLIENT
                          ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━





1 README
════════

  `mastodon.el' is an Emacs client for the ActivityPub social networks
  that implement the Mastodon API. For info see [joinmastodon.org].

  NB: `mastodon.el' now ships this readme as an .info file, so if you
  have it installed you should be able to browse this readme inside
  emacs. `C-h i' for info, then `m masto RET' should load it for you.


[joinmastodon.org] <https://joinmastodon.org/>

1.1 Installation
────────────────

  You can install `mastodon.el' from ELPA, MELPA, or directly from this
  repo.  It is also available as a GUIX package.


1.1.1 ELPA
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  You should be able to directly install with:

  `M-x package-refresh-contents RET'

  `M-x package-install RET mastodon RET'


1.1.2 MELPA
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Add `MELPA' to your archives:

  ┌────
  │ (require 'package)
  │ (add-to-list 'package-archives
  │ 	     '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
  └────

  Update and install:

  `M-x package-refresh-contents RET'

  `M-x package-install RET mastodon RET'


1.1.3 Repo
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Clone this repository and add the lisp directory to your load
  path. Then, require it and go.

  ┌────
  │ (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mastodon.el/lisp")
  │ (require 'mastodon)
  └────

  Or, with `use-package':

  ┌────
  │ (use-package mastodon
  │   :ensure t)
  └────

  The minimum Emacs version is now 28.1. But if you are running an older
  version it shouldn't be very hard to get it working.


1.1.4 Emoji
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Since Emacs 28, it has builtin emoji support with `emoji.el'. If you
  prefer to use [Emojify], `require' it and set `mastodon-use-emojify'
  to non-nil to display emoji in timelines and to use it when composing
  toots. `Emoji.el' is the better option, but for now only `emojify'
  supports downloading and using custom emoji from your instance. From
  personal experience, `emojify' also tends to result in less TOFU.

1.1.5 Discover
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  `mastodon-mode' can provide a context menu for its keybindings if
  [Discover] is installed. It is not required.

  if you have Discover, add the following to your Emacs init
  configuration:

  ┌────
  │ (require 'mastodon-discover)
  │ (with-eval-after-load 'mastodon (mastodon-discover))
  └────

  Or, with `use-package':

  ┌────
  │ (use-package mastodon
  │   :ensure t
  │   :config
  │   (mastodon-discover))
  └────

1.2 Usage
─────────

1.2.1 Logging in to your instance
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  You need to set 2 variables in your init file to get started:

  1. `mastodon-instance-url'
  2. `mastodon-active-user'

  (see their doc strings for details). For example If you want to post
  toots as "example_user@social.instance.org", then put this in your
  init file:

  ┌────
  │ (setq mastodon-instance-url "https://social.instance.org"
  │       mastodon-active-user "example_user")
  └────

  Then *restart* Emacs and run `M-x mastodon'. Make sure you are
  connected to internet before you do this. If you have multiple
  mastodon accounts you can activate one at a time by changing those two
  variables and restarting Emacs.

  If you were using mastodon.el before 2FA was implemented and the above
  steps do not work, call `(mastodon-forget-all-logins)', restart Emacs
  and follow the steps again.


◊ 1.2.1.1 encrypted access tokens (from 2.0.0)

  By default, user access tokens are now stored in the user's auth
  source file (typically `~/.authinfo.gpg', check the value of
  `auth-sources'). When you first update to 2.0.0, or if you encounter
  issues due to old credentials, call `(mastodon-forget-all-logins)' to
  remove the old mastodon.el plstore, and then authenticate again. If
  you don't want to use the auth source file, set
  `mastodon-auth-use-auth-source' to nil. Entries will instead be stored
  encrypted in `mastodon-client--token-file', a plstore.

  If for some reason you reauthenticate, you'll need to either remove
  the entry in your auth sources file, or manually update the token in
  it after doing so, as mastodon.el is unable to reliably update (or
  even remove) entires.

  The format for a mastodon.el auth source entry is as follows:

  `machine INSTANCE login USERNAME password AUTHTOKEN'

  with the token being what you copy from the browser when
  authenticating.  If you have `auth-source-save-behavior' set to nil,
  you'll also need to add such an entry manually.

  Finally, if you find you're asked for your key passphrase too often
  while authenticating, consider setting `epa-file-encrypt-to' (for
  auth-source encryption) and `plstore-encrypt-to' (for plstore
  encryption) to your preferred key ID.


1.2.2 Timelines
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  `M-x mastodon'

  Opens a `*mastodon-home*' buffer in the major mode and displays
  toots. If your credentials are not yet saved, you will be prompted for
  email and password. The app registration process will take place if
  your `mastodon-token-file' does not contain `:client_id' and
  `:client_secret'.

1.2.3 Composing toots
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  `M-x mastodon-toot' (or `t' from a mastodon.el buffer) opens a new
  buffer/window in `text-mode' and `mastodon-toot' minor mode. Enter the
  contents of your toot here. `C-c C-c' sends the toot. `C-c C-k'
  cancels. Both actions kill the buffer and window. Further keybindings
  are displayed in the buffer, and in the following subsection.

  Replies preserve visibility status/content warnings, and include
  boosters by default. If the region is active when you start a reply,
  it will be yanked into the compose buffer prefixed with `>' to form a
  rough reply quote.

  Server's max toot length, with running char count, and attachment
  previews, are shown.

  You can download and use your instance's custom emoji
  (`mastodon-toot--download-custom-emoji',
  `mastodon-toot--enable-custom-emoji').

  If you want to view some of the toot being replied to in the compose
  buffer, set `mastodon-toot-display-orig-in-reply-buffer' to non-nil.

  The compose buffer uses `text-mode' so any configuration you have for
  that mode will be enabled. If any of your existing config conflicts
  with `mastodon-toot', you can disable it in the
  `mastodon-toot-mode-hook'. For example, the default value of that hook
  is as follows:

  ┌────
  │ (add-hook 'mastodon-toot-mode-hook
  │ 	  (lambda ()
  │ 	      (auto-fill-mode -1)))

◊ 1.2.3.2 Autocompletion of mentions, tags and emoji

  Autocompletion of mentions, tags, and emojis is provided by
  `completion-at-point-functions' (capf) backends.
  `mastodon-toot--enable-completion' is enabled by default.

  To trigger completion, type a prefix followed by a few letters, `@'
  for mentions, `#' for tags, and `:' for emoji (for now this only works
  when using `emojify.el').

  If you want to enable `company-mode' in the toot compose buffer, set
  `mastodon-toot--use-company-for-completion' to `t'. (`mastodon.el'
  used to run its own native company backends, but these have been
  removed in favour of capfs.)

  If you don’t run `company' and want immediate, keyless completion,
  you’ll need to have another completion engine running that handles
  capfs. A common combination is `consult' and `corfu'.


◊ 1.2.3.3 Draft toots

  • Compose buffer text is saved as you type, kept in
    `mastodon-toot-current-toot-text'.
  • `mastodon-toot--save-draft': save the current toot as a draft.
  • `mastodon-toot--open-draft-toot': Open a compose buffer and insert
    one of your draft toots.
  • `mastodon-toot--delete-draft-toot': Delete a draft toot.
  • `mastodon-toot--delete-all-drafts': Delete all your drafts.

1.2.5 Notifications
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Mastodon from 4.3 supports grouped notifications. These are
  implemented by `mastodon.el' but disabled by default out of
  consideration to users on instances that don't support them. If you
  are on an instance that implements grouped notifications, set
  `mastodon-group-notifications' to `t' to enable them.


1.2.6 Customization

  An index of all user-facing commands and custom variables is available
  here: [mastodon-index.org].

  You can also hit `?' in any `mastodon.el' buffer to see the available
  bindings, or run `M-X' (upper-case `X') to view all commands in the
  buffer with completion, and call one.

  The incomparable Nicholas Rougier has written an alternative timeline
  layout for `mastodon.el'.

  The repo is at [mastodon-alt].

◊ 1.2.8.2 Org links, archive search

  [toot-suite] implements an org link type for fediverse posts, and also
  provides a way to browse an offline archive of your account.

1.2.9 Live-updating timelines: `mastodon-async-mode'
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  (code taken from [mastodon-future].)

  Works for federated, local, and home timelines and for
  notifications. It's a little touchy, one thing to avoid is trying to
  load a timeline more than once at a time. It can go off the rails a
  bit, but it's still pretty cool.  The current maintainer of
  `mastodon.el' is unable to debug or improve this feature.

  To enable, it, add `(require 'mastodon-async)' to your `init.el'. Then
  you can view a timeline with one of the commands that begin with
  `mastodon-async--stream-'.

1.2.10 Translating toots
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  You can translate toots with `mastodon-toot--translate-toot-text' (`a'
  in a timeline). At the moment this requires [lingva.el], a little
  interface I wrote to [lingva.ml], to be installed to work.

  You could easily modify the simple function to use your Emacs
  translator of choice (`libretrans.el' , `google-translate', `babel',
  `go-translate', etc.), you just need to fetch the toot's content with
  `(mastodon-tl--content toot)' and pass it to your translator function
  as its text argument. Here's what `mastodon-toot--translate-toot-text'
  looks like:

  ┌────
  │ (defun mastodon-toot-translate-toot-text ()
  │   "Translate text of toot at point.
  │   Uses `lingva.el'."
  │     (interactive)
  │     (let* ((toot (mastodon-tl--property 'item-json)))
  │       (if toot
  │ 	  (lingva-translate nil (mastodon-tl--content toot))
  │ 	(message "No toot to translate?"))))
  └────

1.2.11 Bookmarks and `mastodon.el'
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  `mastodon.el' implements a basic bookmark record and
  handler. Currently, this means that you can bookmark a post item and
  later load it in thread view. This could be expanded to any item with
  an id, but probably not to things like timeline views. If you want to
  be able to bookmark something, open an issue and ask, as it's trivial
  to expand the bookmarking code.


1.3 Dependencies
────────────────

  Hard dependencies (should all install with `mastodon.el'):
  • `request' (for uploading attachments, [emacs-request])
  • `persist' (for storing some settings across sessions, [persist])
  • `tp.el' (for transient menus, [tp.el])

  Optional dependencies (install yourself, `mastodon.el' can use them):
  • `emojify' to use custom emoji (else we use builtin `emoji.el')
  • `mpv' and `mpv.el' for viewing videos and gifs
  • `lingva.el' for translating toots


[emacs-request] <https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request>

[persist] <https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/persist.html>

[tp.el] <https://codeberg.org/martianh/tp.el>


1.4 Network compatibility
─────────────────────────

  `mastodon.el' should work with ActivityPub servers that implement the
  Mastodon API.

  Apart from Mastodon itself, it is currently known to work with:
  • Pleroma ([pleroma.social])
  • Akkoma ([akkoma.social])
  • Gotosocial ([gotosocial.org])
  • Sharkey ([joinsharkey.org])

  It does not support the non-Mastodon API servers Misskey
  ([misskey.io]), Firefish ([joinfirefish.org], formerly Calkey) and
  Friendica, but it should fully support displaying and interacting with
  posts and users on those platforms.

  If you attempt to use `mastodon.el' with a server and run into
  problems, feel free to open an issue.


[pleroma.social] <https://pleroma.social/>

[akkoma.social] <https://akkoma.social/>

1.5 Contributing
────────────────

  PRs, issues, feature requests, and general feedback are very welcome!

  If you prefer emailing patches to the process described below, feel
  free to send them on. Ideally they'd be patches that can be applied
  with `git am', if you want to actually contribute a commit.


1.5.1 Bug reports
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  1. `mastodon.el' has bugs, as well as lots of room for improvement.
  2. I receive very little feedback, so if I don't run into the bug it
     often doesn't get fixed.
  3. If you run into something that seems broken, first try running
     `mastodon.el' in emacs with no init file (i.e. `emacs -q'
     (instructions and code for doing this are [here]) to see if it also
     happens independently of your own config (it probably does).
  4. Else enable debug on error (`toggle-debug-on-error'), make the bug
     happen again, and copy the backtrace that appears.
  5. Open an issue here and explain what is going on. Provide your emacs
     version and what kind of server your account is on.

1.5.2 Fixes and features
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  1. Create an [issue] detailing what you'd like to do.
  2. Fork the repository and create a branch off of `develop'.
  3. Run the tests and ensure that your code doesn't break any of them.
  4. Create a pull request (to develop) referencing the issue created in
     step 1.


[issue] <https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el/issues>


1.5.3 Coding style
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • This library uses an unconvential double dash (`--') between file
    namespaces and function names, which contradicts normal Elisp style.
    This needs to be respected until the whole library is changed.
  • Use `aggressive-indent-mode' or similar to keep your code indented.
  • Single spaces end sentences in docstrings.
  • There's no need for a blank line after the first docstring line (one
    is added automatically when documentation is displayed).


1.6 Supporting `mastodon.el'
