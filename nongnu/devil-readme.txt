  Devil mode trades your comma key in exchange for a modifier-free
  editing experience in Emacs.  Yes, the comma key!  The key you would
  normally wield for punctuation in nearly every corner of text.  Yes,
  this is twisted!  It would not be called the Devil otherwise, would
  it?  If it were any more rational, we might call it something divine,
  like, uh, the God mode?  But alas, there is nothing divine to be found
  here.  Welcome, instead, to the realm of the Devil!  You will be
  granted the occasional use of the comma key for punctuation, but only
  if you can charm the Devil!  But beware, for in this sinister domain,
  you must relinquish your comma key and embrace an editing experience
  that whispers wicked secrets into your fingertips!

1.1 Get Started
───────────────

  By default, Devil mode rebinds the comma key to activate Devil.  Once
  activated, Devil reads a so-called Devil key sequence from you.  As
  you type your Devil key sequence, Devil translates the key sequence to
  a regular Emacs key sequence.  If any command is bound to the
  translated Emacs key sequence, Devil runs that command and then
  deactivates itself.

  By default, each comma in the Devil key sequence is translated to
  "C-".  For example, if you type ", x , f", Devil translates it to "C-x
  C-f".  Similarly, "m" is translated to "M-", so if you type ", m s",
  Devil translates it to "C-M-s".  There are several other translations
  available in the default translation rules that let you enjoy working
  with Emacs while avoiding modifier keys.  Further, the Devil
  activation key, translation rules, etc. are customisable.

  Read the [manual] to learn how to install, use, and customise Devil.
