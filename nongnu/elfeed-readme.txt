                      ELFEED EMACS WEB FEED READER
                     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


Elfeed is an extensible web feed reader for Emacs, supporting Atom, RSS
and JSON Feed. It requires Emacs 28.1 and is available for download from
[ELPA] or [MELPA].  The Elfeed UI was inspired by [notmuch]. The
database format is stable and is never expected to change.

1 Prerequisites
═══════════════

  *It is strongly recommended you have curl installed*, either in your
  PATH or configured via `elfeed-curl-program-name'. Elfeed will prefer
  it to Emacs' own URL-fetching mechanism, `url-retrieve'. It's also
  essential for running Elfeed on Windows, where `url-retrieve' is
  broken. Updates using curl are significantly faster than the built-in
  method, both for you and the feed hosts.

  If this is giving you problems, fetching with curl can be disabled by
  setting `elfeed-use-curl' to nil.


2 Getting Started
═════════════════

  We recommend that you install Elfeed via `M-x package-install'. You
  may want to define a a global binding for the main entry point command
  `elfeed'.

  ┌────
  │ (keymap-global-set "C-x w" #'elfeed)
  └────

  Running the interactive function `elfeed' will pop up the
  `*elfeed-search*' buffer, which will display feed items.

  • `g': refresh view of the feed listing
  • `G': fetch feed updates from the servers
  • `s': update the search filter (see tags)
  • `S': update the search filter statically
  • `c': clear the search filter
  • `@': add current date to the filter
  • `=': only include current feed
  • `~': exclude current feed

  This buffer will be empty until you add your feeds to the
  `elfeed-feeds' list and initiate an update with `M-x elfeed-update'
  (or press `G' in the Elfeed buffer).  This will populate the Elfeed
  database with entries.

  ┌────
  │ ;; Somewhere in your .emacs file
  │ (setq elfeed-feeds
  │       '("https://nullprogram.com/feed/"
  │         "https://planet.emacslife.com/atom.xml"))
  └────

  Another option for providing a feed list is with an OPML file. Running
  `M-x elfeed-load-opml' will fill `elfeed-feeds' with feeds listed in
  an OPML file. When `elfeed-load-opml' is called interactively, it will
  automatically save the feedlist to your customization file, so you
  will only need to do this once.

  If there are a lot of feeds, the initial update will take noticeably
  longer than normal operation because of the large amount of
  information being written the database. Future updates will only need
  to write new or changed data. If updating feeds slows down Emacs too
  much for you, reduce the number of concurrent fetches via
  `elfeed-set-max-connections'.

  If you're getting many "Queue timeout exceeded" errors, increase the
  fetch timeout via `elfeed-set-timeout'.

  ┌────
  │ (setf url-queue-timeout 30)
  └────

  From the search buffer there are a number of ways to interact with
  entries.  Entries are selected by placing the point over an
  entry. Multiple entries are selected at once by using an active
  region.

  • `RET': view selected entry in a buffer
  • `b': open selected entries in your browser
  • `B': open selected entries in your secondary browser
  • `y': copy selected entries URL to the clipboard
  • `r': tag selected entries as read (`C-u r' to tag all)
  • `u': tag selected entries as unread (`C-u u' to tag all)
  • `+': add a specific tag to selected entries
  • `-': remove a specific tag from selected entries
  • `m': mark candidate
  • `M': unmark candidate (`C-u M' to unmark all)
  • `t': set title of selected entry
  • `T': set title of selected feed


3 Tags
══════

  Elfeed maintains a list of arbitrary tags – symbols attached to an
  entry. The tag `unread' is treated specially by default, with unread
  entries appearing in bold.


3.1 Autotagging
───────────────

  Tags can automatically be applied to entries discovered in specific
  feeds through extra syntax in `elfeed-feeds'. Normally this is a list
  of strings, but an item can also be a list, providing set of
  "autotags" for a feed's entries.

  ┌────
  │ (setq elfeed-feeds
  │       '(("https://nullprogram.com/feed/" blog emacs)
  │         "https://sachachua.com/blog/category/emacs-news/feed/" ;; no autotagging
  │         ("https://nedroid.com/feed/" webcomic)))
  └────


3.2 Filter Syntax
─────────────────

  To make tags useful, the Elfeed entry listing buffer can be filtered
  by tags.  Use `elfeed-search-set-filter' (or s) to update the
  filter. Use `elfeed-search-clear-filter' to restore the default.

  Any component of the search string beginning with a `+' or a `-' is
  treated like a tag. `+' means the tag is required, `-' means the tag
  must not be present.

  A component beginning with a `@' indicates an age or a date range. An
  age is a relative time expression or an absolute date
  expression. Entries older than this age are filtered out. The age
  description accepts plain English, but cannot have spaces, so use
  dashes. For example, `@2-years-old', `@3-days-ago' or `@2019-06-24'.
  The dashes and suffixes like `-old' are ignored, such that you can use
  a shorter form , e.g., `@2years'. A date range are two ages separated
  by a `--' e.g., `@2019-06-20--2019-06-24' or
  `@5-days-ago--1-day-ago'. The entry must be newer than the first
  expression but older than the second. The database is date-oriented,
  so *filters that include an age restriction are significantly more
  efficient.*

  A component beginning with a `!' is treated as an "inverse" regular
  expression.  This means that any entry matching this regular
  expression will be filtered out.  The regular expression begins
  /after/ the `!' character. You can read this as "entry not matching
  `foo'".

  A component beginning with a `#' limits the total number of entries
  displayed to the number immediately following the symbol. For example,
  to limit the display to 20 entries: `#20'.

  A component beginning with a `=' is a regular expression matching the
  entry's feed (title or URL). Only entries belonging to a feed that
  matches at least one of the `=' expressions will be shown.

  A component beginning with a `~' is a regular expression matching the
  entry's feed (title or URL). Only entries belonging to a feed that
  matches none of the `~' expressions will be shown.

  All other components are treated as a regular expression, and only
  entries matching it (title or URL) will be shown.

  Here are some example filters.

  • `@6months +unread'

  Only show unread entries of the last six months. This is the default
  filter.

  • `linu[xs] @1-year-old'

  Only show entries about Linux or Linus from the last year.

  • `-unread +youtube #10'

  Only show the most recent 10 previously-read entries tagged as
  `youtube'.

  • `+unread !x?emacs'

  Only show unread entries not having `emacs' or `xemacs' in the title
  or link.

  • `+emacs =https://example.org/feed/'

  Only show entries tagged as `emacs' from a specific feed.


3.2.1 Default Search Filter
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  You can set your default search filter by changing the default value
  of `elfeed-search-filter'. It only changes buffer-locally when you're
  adjusting the filter within Elfeed.

  ┌────
  │ (setq-default elfeed-search-filter "@1week +unread")
  └────


3.3 Tag Hooks
─────────────

  The last example assumes you've tagged posts with `youtube'. You
  probably want to do this sort of thing automatically, either through
  the "autotags" feature mentioned above, or with the
  `elfeed-new-entry-hook'. Functions in this hook are called with new
  entries, allowing them to be manipulated, such as adding tags.

  ┌────
  │ ;; Mark all YouTube entries
  │ (add-hook 'elfeed-new-entry-hook
  │           (elfeed-make-tagger :feed-url "youtube\\.com"
  │                               :add '(video youtube)))
  └────

  Avoiding tagging old entries as `unread':

  ┌────
  │ ;; Entries older than 2 weeks are tagged as read
  │ (add-hook 'elfeed-new-entry-hook
  │           (elfeed-make-tagger :before "2 weeks ago"
  │                               :remove 'unread))
  └────

  Or building your own subset feeds:

  ┌────
  │ (add-hook 'elfeed-new-entry-hook
  │           (elfeed-make-tagger :feed-url "example\\.com"
  │                               :entry-title '(not "something interesting")
  │                               :add 'junk
  │                               :remove 'unread))
  └────

  Use `M-x elfeed-apply-hooks-now' to apply `elfeed-new-entry-hook' to
  all existing entries. Otherwise hooks will only apply to new entries
  on discovery.


3.4 Custom Tag Faces
────────────────────

  By default, entries tagged `unread' will have bolded titles in the
  `*elfeed-search*' listing. You can customize how tags affect an
  entry's appearance by customizing `elfeed-search-face-alist'. For
  example, this configuration makes entries tagged `important' stand out
  in red.

  ┌────
  │ (defface important-elfeed-entry
  │   '((t :foreground "#f77"))
  │   "Marks an important Elfeed entry.")
  │ 
  │ (push '(important important-elfeed-entry)
  │       elfeed-search-face-alist)
  └────

  All faces from all tags will be applied to the entry title. The faces
  will be ordered as they appear in `elfeed-search-face-alist'.


4 Tree view
═══════════

  Elfeed includes a tree view, which gives an overview over all feeds
  and tags.  Invoke `M-x elfeed-tree' to open it. The feeds are
  visualized as a tree using the feed auto tags. The first auto tag is
  the root node, the second tag comes below, and so on. Feeds with the
  same auto tags are grouped together. Since `outline-minor-mode' is
  enabled in the buffer you can use `TAB' and `S-TAB' to fold like in
  Org-mode buffers. Use `RET' or click on tags or feeds to show the
  corresponding `elfeed-search' buffer.

  For example the configuration

  ┌────
  │ (setq elfeed-feeds
  │       '(("https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/new.atom" emacs lists devel)
  │         ("https://yhetil.org/emacs-bugs/new.atom" emacs lists bugs)
  │         ("https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs.rss" emacs reddit)))
  └────

  leads to a tree of the following form.

  ┌────
  │ emacs
  │   ├─● /r/reddit
  │   lists
  │     ├─● emacs-devel
  │     ╰─● emacs-bugs
  │ [all feeds]
  │   ├─● …
  │   ╰─● emacs-devel
  │ [all tags]
  │   ├─● …
  │   ╰─● emacs
  │        ├─● …
  │        ╰─● emacs-devel
  └────


5 Bookmarks
═══════════

  Filters can be saved and restored using Emacs' built-in [bookmarks
  feature]. While in the search buffer, use `M-x bookmark-set' to save
  the current filter, and `M-x bookmark-jump' to restore a saved
  filter. Emacs automatically persists bookmarks across sessions.


[bookmarks feature]
<https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bookmarks.html>


6 Org-store-link and Org-capture
════════════════════════════════

  When `org-store-link' is called from an Elfeed search or an Elfeed
  entry, a link to the search or entry is stored in Org-mode format.

  This link can be inserted into an Org-mode document. If the link is
  opened, the search or entry will be shown in Elfeed.

  In addition to the link, `org-store-link' also store some additional
  properties.  You can access them in an Org-capture template with the
  template expansion `%:keyword'. (`org-store-link' is automatically
  called when you do a capture.)

  List of available keywords, when link is stored from an Elfeed search:

  • `type' : Type of Org-mode link
  • `link' : Org-mode link to this search, also available with `%a',
    `%A', `%l' and `%L'
  • `description' : The search filter

  List of available keywords, when link is stored from an Elfeed entry:

  • `type' : Type of Org-mode link
  • `link' : Org-mode link to this entry, also available with `%a',
    `%A', `%l' and `%L'
  • `title' : Feed entry title
  • `description' : Feed entry description, same as title
  • `external-link' : Feed entry external link
  • `date' : Date time of the feed entry publication, in full ISO 8601
    format
  • `date-timestamp' : Date time of the feed entry publication, in
    Org-mode active timestamp format
  • `date-inactive-timestamp' : Date time of the feed entry publication,
    in Org-mode inactive timestamp format
  • `authors' : List of feed entry authors names, joint by a comma
  • `tags' : List of feed entry tags, in Org-mode tags format
  • `content' : Content of the feed entry
  • `feed-title' : Title of the feed
  • `feed-external-link' : Feed external link
  • `feed-authors' : List of feed authors names, joint by a comma

  If `content' type is HTML, it is automatically embedded into an
  Org-mode HTML quote.


7 Feed options
══════════════

  The `elfeed-feeds' variable allows you to set options per feed as a
  plist in addition to the auto tags which come after the options. The
  options can be accessed like the usual metadata via `(elfeed-meta feed
  :key)'. Right now Elfeed supports these special keys which you may
  want to override in the `elfeed-feeds' list.

  • `:no-update' : Prevent a feed from updating when invoking
    `elfeed-update'.
  • `:fetch-link' : Automatically fetch the content of the link and
    display it in the `elfeed-show' buffer.
  • `:readable' : Enable readable mode in the `elfeed-show' buffer.
  • `:show-entry' : Specify an alternative show function, e.g.,
    `browse-url'.
  • `:title' : Override the feed title.

  Example:

  ┌────
  │ (setq elfeed-feeds
  │       '(("https://planet.emacslife.com/atom.xml" :no-update t :title "Planetemacs" emacs)
  │         ("https://sachachua.com/blog/category/emacs-news/feed/" :show-entry eww-browse-url emacs)
  │         ("https://www.debian.org/security/dsa" :fetch-link replace :readable t security)))
  └────

  You can define custom properties for your own purposes but you may
  consider namespacing the keys with a prefix to avoid collisions.


8 Metadata Plist
════════════════

  All feed and entry objects have plist where you can store your own
  arbitrary, [readable values]. These values are automatically persisted
  in the database. This metadata is accessed using the polymorphic
  `elfeed-meta' function. The function is a generalized variable, such
  that it is `setf'-able. The macro `setf' must have access to the
  definition of `elfeed-meta' at compile time. Therefore you must add a
  `(require 'elfeed)' at the top level, such that the Elisp byte
  compiler loads the definition.

  ┌────
  │ (require 'elfeed) ;; Necessary for macro expansion of (setf (elfeed-meta ...) ...)
  │ 
  │ (setf (elfeed-meta entry :rating) 4)
  │ (elfeed-meta entry :rating)
  │ ;; => 4
  │ 
  │ (setf (elfeed-meta feed :title) "My Better Title")
  └────

  Elfeed itself adds some entries to this plist, some for your use, some
  for its own use. Here are the properties that Elfeed uses:

  • `:authors' : A list of author plists (`:name', `:uri', `:email').
  • `:canonical-url' : The final URL for the feed after all redirects.
  • `:categories' : The feed-supplied categories for this entry.
  • `:etag' : HTTP Etag header, for conditional GETs.
  • `:failures' : Number of times this feed has failed to update.
  • `:last-modified' : HTTP Last-Modified header, for conditional GETs.
  • `:title' : Overrides the feed-supplied title for display purposes,
    both for feeds and entries. See also `elfeed-search-set-feed-title'
    and `elfeed-search-set-entry-title'.
  • `:link-content' : The HTML content fetched from the entry link, see
    `elfeed-show-fetch-link'.

  This list will grow in time, so you might consider namespacing your
  own properties to avoid collisions (e.g. `:xyz/rating'), or simply not
  using keywords as keys. Elfeed will always use keywords without a
  slash.

9 Hooks
═══════

  A number of hooks are available to customize the behavior of Elfeed at
  key points without resorting to advice.

  • `elfeed-new-entry-hook' : Called each time a new entry it added to
    the database, allowing for automating tagging and such.
  • `elfeed-new-entry-parse-hook' : Called with each new entry and the
    full XML structure from which it was parsed, allowing for additional
    information to be drawn from the original feed XML.
  • `elfeed-http-error-hook' : Allows for special behavior when HTTP
    errors occur, beyond simply logging the error to the buffer named
    `elfeed-log-buffer-name'.
  • `elfeed-parse-error-hook' : Allows for special behavior when feed
    parsing fails, beyond logging.
  • `elfeed-db-update-hook' : Called any time the database has had a
    major modification.
  • `elfeed-db-unload-hook' : Called before unloading the database.
  • `elfeed-update-hook' : Called any time a feed is updated.
  • `elfeed-update-init-hook' : Called before feed updates.
  • `elfeed-tag-hook' : Called before an entry gets tagged.
  • `elfeed-untag-hook' : Called before an entry gets untagged.
  • `elfeed-show-update-hook' : Called after the show buffer has been
    updated.
  • `elfeed-search-update-hook' : Called after the search buffer has
    been updated.
  • `elfeed-tree-update-hook' : Called after the tree buffer has been
    updated.


10 Viewing Entries
══════════════════

  Entries are viewed locally in Emacs by typing `RET' while over an
  entry in the search listing. The content will be displayed in a
  separate buffer using `elfeed-show-mode', rendered using Emacs'
  built-in shr package. This requires an Emacs compiled with `libxml2'
  bindings, which provides the necessary HTML parser.

  Sometimes displaying images can slow down or even crash Emacs. Set
  `shr-inhibit-images' to disable images if this is a problem.


11 Web Interface
════════════════

  A demonstration/toy web interface for remote network access to Elfeed
  exists in a [separate repository]. It's a single-page web application
  that follows the database live as new entries arrive. It's packaged
  separately as `elfeed-web'. To fire it up, run `M-x elfeed-web-start'
  and visit <http://localhost:8080/elfeed/> (check your `httpd-port')
  with a browser. See the `elfeed-web.el' header for endpoint
  documentation if you'd like to access the Elfeed database through the
  web API.

  It's rough and unfinished – no keyboard shortcuts, read-only, no
  authentication, and a narrow entry viewer. This is basically Elfeed's
  "mobile" interface. Patches welcome.


[separate repository] <https://github.com/emacs-elfeed/elfeed-web>


12 Platform Support
═══════════════════

  Summary: Install curl and most problems disappear for all platforms.

  I personally only use Elfeed on Linux, but it's occasionally tested on
  Windows.  Unfortunately the Windows port of Emacs is a bit too
  unstable for parallel feed downloads with `url-retrieve', not to
  mention the [tiny, hard-coded, 512 open descriptor limitation], so it
  limits itself to one feed at a time on this platform.

  If you fetch HTTPS feeds without curl on /any/ platform, it's
  essential that Emacs is built with the `--with-gnutls'
  option. Otherwise Emacs runs gnutls in an inferior process, which
  rarely works well.


[tiny, hard-coded, 512 open descriptor limitation]
<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kdfaxaay%28vs.71%29.aspx>


13 Database Management
══════════════════════

  The database should keep itself under control without any manual
  intervention, but steps can be taken to minimize the database size if
  desired. The simplest option is to run the `elfeed-db-compact'
  command, which will pack the loose-file content database into a single
  compressed file. We recommend to execute `elfeed-db-compact' from time
  to time manually.

  Going further, a function could be added to `elfeed-new-entry-hook' to
  strip unwanted/unneeded content from select entries before being
  stored in the database. For example, for YouTube videos only the entry
  link is of interest and the regularly-changing entry content could be
  tossed to save time and storage.

  ┌────
  │ (defun strip-old-content ()
  │   (let ((limit (elfeed-float-time "60 days ago")))
  │     (elfeed-db-visit (entry feed)
  │       (cond
  │        ((< (elfeed-entry-date entry) limit)
  │         (elfeed-db-return))
  │        ((equal "https://example.com/feed/" (elfeed-feed-url feed))
  │         (setf (elfeed-entry-content entry) nil))))))
  └────


14 Status and Roadmap
═════════════════════

  Elfeed is a mature and maintained Emacs package, which should
  integrate well into your Emacs setup. It is to the point where it can
  serve 100% of your web feed needs, even if you use hundreds of
  feeds. We still have to decide on a future roadmap, but our goal is to
  preserve the overall character and behavior of Elfeed.


15 Motivation
═════════════

  As far as I know, outside of Elfeed there does not exist an
  extensible, text-file configured, power-user web feed client that can
  handle a reasonable number of feeds. The existing clients I've tried
  are missing some important capability that limits its usefulness to
  me.


16 Extensions
═════════════

  There are projects which extend Elfeed with additional features. The
  following packages provide significant additional functionality and
  have more than 5K downloads on [MELPA], which hints at a certain
  maturity. Note that no guarantees for compatibility are made.

  • [elfeed-protocol]: Support for many fetching methods.
  • [elfeed-score]: Gnus-like scoring.
  • [elfeed-tube]: Enhancements for Youtube feeds.
  • [elfeed-web]: Web interface to Elfeed.

  Many more extensions can be found on MELPA - here is an non-exhaustive
