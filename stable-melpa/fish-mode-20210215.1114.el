;;; Commentary:

;; A very basic version of major mode for fish shell scripts.
;; Current features:
;;
;;  - keyword highlight
;;  - basic indent
;;  - comment detection
;;  - run fish_indent for indention
;;
;;  To run fish_indent before save, add the following to init script:
;;  (add-hook 'fish-mode-hook (lambda ()
;;                              (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'fish_indent-before-save)))
;;
;;  Configuration:
;;  fish-indent-offset: customize the indentation

;;; Code:

(defgroup fish nil
  "Fish shell support."
  :group 'languages)

(defcustom fish-indent-offset 4

   ;; is used here.

   ;; (i.e. if an option in the second group appears before an option
   ;; in the first group, it doesn't match at all). The help for
   ;; font-lock-keywords doesn't mention anything about matching
   ;; subsequent MATCH-ANCHORED expressions in order, but it appears
   ;; to do so.
