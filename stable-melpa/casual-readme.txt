INSTALLATION

Users can choose any or all of the user interfaces made available by Casual
at their pleasure.

Configuration of a particular Casual user interface is performed per mode.
For details, refer to the Info node `(casual) Install'.

Casual relies on the latest stable release of `transient' which may differ
from the version that is preinstalled as a built-in. By b default, `package.el'
will not upgrade a built-in package. Set the customizable variable
`package-install-upgrade-built-in' to `t' to override this. For more details,
please refer to the "Install" section on this project's repository web page.
