;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file is for lazy people wanting to swap buffers without
;; typing C-x b on each window. This is useful when you have :

;; |    #emacs    |    #gnus    |

;; With buffer-move, just go in #gnus, do buf-move-left, go to #emacs
;; (which now should be on top right) and do buf-move-down.
;;
;; To use it, simply put a (require 'buffer-move) in your ~/.emacs and
;; define some keybindings. For example, i use :
;;
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-up>")     'buf-move-up)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-down>")   'buf-move-down)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-left>")   'buf-move-left)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-right>")  'buf-move-right)
;;
;; Alternatively, you may let the current window switch back to the previous
;; buffer, instead of swapping the buffers of both windows. Set the
;; following customization variable to 'move to activate this behavior:
;;
;; (setq buffer-move-behavior 'move)
