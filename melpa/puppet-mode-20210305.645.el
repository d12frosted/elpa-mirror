;;; Commentary:

;; GNU Emacs 24 major mode for editing Puppet manifests.

;; Provides syntax highlighting, indentation, alignment, movement, Imenu and
;; code checking.

;; Syntax highlighting: Fontification supports all of Puppet 3 syntax, including
;; variable expansion in strings.

;; Indentation: Indent expressions automatically.

;; Alignment: Provide alignment rules for common Puppet expressions, and align
;; the current block with `puppet-align-block' on C-c C-a.

;; Movement: Move to the beginning or end of the current block with
;; `beginning-of-defun' (C-M-a) and `end-of-defun' (C-M-e) respectively.

;; Imenu: Jump to a tag in the current buffer with `imenu' on C-c C-j.  Index
;; variables, resource defaults, classes, nodes, defined types and resource
;; declarations.

;; Code checking: Validate the syntax of the current buffer with
;; `puppet-validate' on C-c C-v.  Lint the current buffer for semantic errors
;; with `puppet-lint' on C-c C-l.  Apply the current buffer with `puppet-apply'
;; on C-c C-c.

;; Syntax checking: Flymake support is _not_ provided.  See Flycheck at
;; http://www.flycheck.org for on-the-fly validation and liniting of Puppet
;; manifests.
